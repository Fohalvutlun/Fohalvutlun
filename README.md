Hi there!

You can call me Ty, and i do some small projects here and there.
Most of my projects are private, so sorry if there isn't that much here.

Most of my experience is around simple, heavily focused, backend applications, 
mostly as a vector to apply some new thing that i'm learning about at the time.
The projects "play": 
  - JavaScript 
  - Java
  - Prolog (which i found really refreshing!)
I've played with other stuff but no projects here reflect that.


As of the moment i'm trying to wrap my head around DDD & Rober Martin's "Clean Architecture", 
not the model itself, but the concepts that he echoes through his book about maintanbility
"Clean Architecture: A Craftsman’s Guide to Software Structure and Design".

I don't feel that i'm ready to commit myself to bigger projects currently but maybe in the future i'll feel ready.
